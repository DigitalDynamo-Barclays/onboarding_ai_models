# onboarding_ai_models
We trained all these models with a <b>custom made dataset <b>which automates the whole Document extraction via calling <bHosted API's>, <br>
<i>this increases the cost<i> so we have also uploaded a example for BRP which shows how we intended to solve this via OCR but the hosted API<br>
makes the whole process seamless with time less than 1.2seconds.<br>
In the <b>time duration<b> it was not possible to build a model for all the document verification option we are providing the user so the experience is <b>hassle-less<b> 
as the user can easily upload any document which is easily available to him.<br>
The MODELS built on custom datasets are:<br>
1. BRP<br>
2.Indian Driving License<br>
3.UK Driving License<br>
4.PAN CARD
<br>
other models used are:<br>
5. Indian Passport <br>
6. British Passport<br>
7. British Proof of Address<br>

pre-built models which are extensively trained and give the output directly as JSON format which is then converted to DART so our app can process<br>
the data.<br>
All the credits for the prebuilt models goes to Mindee.
